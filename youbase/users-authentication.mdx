## User Management

The User Management module consists of two main components:
- **User List**: View user details and perform management actions
- **Dashboard**: Monitor total users (registered and temporary), daily activity, and trends

### Dashboard

The Dashboard provides visual insights into your user base:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User Statistics" icon="users">
    View total counts for registered users and temporary accounts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Daily Trends" icon="chart-area">
    Track daily activity and growth patterns over time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### User List

The User List displays all registered users in your project.

<Note>
**No users yet.**

Users will appear here once someone signs up or logs in.
</Note>

Each user row displays the following information:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User ID" icon="fingerprint">
    System-generated unique identifier
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Address" icon="at">
    User's registered email
  </Card>
  <Card title="Login Method" icon="right-to-bracket">
    Email, Google, or Temporary
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Status" icon="circle-check">
    Active or Blocked
  </Card>
  <Card title="Created At" icon="calendar">
    Account creation timestamp
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
All timestamps are displayed in the user's local timezone. User IDs are immutable and used internally to associate data with users.
</Info>

### User Operations

User management supports four actions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Add User" icon="user-plus">
    Manually create a new user account
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete User" icon="user-minus">
    Remove a user account (the user can re-register afterwards; useful for removing test data)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Block User" icon="ban">
    Suspend user access (blocked users cannot log in or re-register)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unblock User" icon="circle-check">
    Restore access for a previously blocked user
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Delete vs Block**: Deleted users can re-register with the same email. Blocked users cannot log in or re-register until unblocked.
</Tip>

## Email Security

Configure email-related security options for your project.

<Warning>
**Email Verification**: Require users to verify their email address before logging in. Enable this option to ensure users provide valid email addresses.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Email Verification" icon="envelope-circle-check">
    Require users to verify their email before accessing the app
  </Card>
  <Card title="Password Reset Verification" icon="key">
    Require email verification code when resetting passwords
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logout All Devices on Password Change" icon="right-from-bracket">
    Automatically sign out all sessions when a user changes their password
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Custom UI

The login component uses a platform-provided default style.

To customize the login UI, send prompts to Agent, which modifies and re-renders the UI based on your instructions.

<Info>
**Example prompt:**

Update the default login UI to match our current website style.
</Info>

If you later update your Auth configuration, send another prompt to Agent to re-render the login UI based on the latest Auth configuration.

<Info>
**Example prompt:**

Re-render the login UI based on the latest Auth configuration.
</Info>

## When you might not need Users & Auth

<Note>
If your project:

- Is purely informational or static

You can keep **Users & Auth** disabled and enable it later when needed.
</Note>
