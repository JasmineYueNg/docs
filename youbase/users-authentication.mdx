# Users & Authentication

Users & Auth provides account and identity management for your project.

It allows your project to recognize users, manage login access, and associate data or behavior with specific user accounts.

## User List Overview

The user list displays all registered users in your project.

When no users exist yet, the empty state shows:

<Note>
**No users yet.**

Users will appear here once someone signs up or logs in.
</Note>

Once users are present, the list displays key information for each user account.

## User Table Details

Each user row includes:

  </Card>

## User Status & Access Control

You can manage user access directly from the user list.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View User List">
    Navigate to the Users & Auth section in YouBase to see all registered users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click on a user row to view their details and available actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Block or Allow Access">
    Toggle user access status. Blocking a user immediately prevents further login.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Allow Access" icon="circle-check">
    User can log in and use the application normally
  </Card>
  <Card title="Block Access" icon="ban">
    User cannot log in until access is restored. Existing data is retained.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
User deletion is not supported in YouBase 1.0 to prevent accidental data loss. Block users instead of deleting them.
</Tip>
