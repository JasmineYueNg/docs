## Storage Overview

The storage list shows all files and folders stored in your project.

When no files exist, the empty state shows:

<Note>

Files will appear here once they're uploaded.

Once files are available, the storage list displays all uploaded content organized by folders.

## Storage Limitations (YouBase 1.0)

In YouBase 1.0, certain features are intentionally limited:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Upload & Download" icon="circle-check">
    File upload and download are **supported**
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Preview" icon="circle-xmark">
    File preview is **not supported**
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Deletion" icon="circle-xmark">
    File deletion is **not supported**
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Modification" icon="circle-xmark">
    Agents **cannot** directly modify storage contents
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
These limitations are intentional to reduce risk and complexity in early versions. File management features will be expanded in future releases.
</Warning>

# Common Use Cases

Below are common scenarios where **Storage** is useful.

Use these examples to decide whether your project needs file upload and download capabilities.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. User uploads (images, documents, attachments)" icon="image">
    **Scenario**

    Users need to upload files as part of your product experience.

    **Examples**
    - Profile photos / avatars
    - Resume or document uploads
    - Attachments submitted with forms

    **What Storage provides**
    - A safe place to store uploaded files
    - Download access when you need to retrieve files later
    - A reliable file layer for real user workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Generated files and AI outputs" icon="robot">

    - Exported summaries or results
    - Generated images or documents

    **What Storage provides**
    - A place to store generated assets

    *(Often used together with Functions)*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Media or documents linked to database records" icon="database">

    - A CRM where each customer record stores documents

    **What Storage provides**
    - File storage that can be associated with database records
    - A simple way to manage assets across your app

    *(Often used together with Database)*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Multi-file downloads (bundles)" icon="file-zipper">
    **Scenario**

    Users need to download multiple files at once.

    **Examples**

    Files should remain accessible after refresh, logout, or on another device.

    **Examples**
    - A workspace where users revisit uploaded documents later
    - A tool that stores ongoing project assets
    - Returning users downloading previously generated outputs

    **What Storage provides**
    - Persistent, cloud-hosted file storage
    - Consistent access across sessions and environments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When you might not need Storage

<Note>
You may not need Storage if your project:

- Doesn't accept uploads
- Doesn't generate downloadable files
- Doesn't attach media/documents to stored records

Storage can be enabled later when your project expands into file-based workflows.
</Note>

---

## Note (YouBase 1.0)

<Info>
In YouBase 1.0, Storage supports **upload + download**, but some management features (like previews and deletion) are intentionally limited.

This keeps early versions safer and simpler while most real workflows still work end-to-end.
