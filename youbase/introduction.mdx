# What is YouBase?

**YouBase is YouWare's built-in cloud database** — think of it as the backend that powers your application.

If YouWare's visual interface is your app's "face," then YouBase is its "brain" and "memory." Without YouBase, your app is just a pretty picture: forms can't save data, users can't log in, and nothing persists. **With YouBase enabled, your app can actually "remember" user data and display personalized content for each person.**

---

## Overview

YouBase is YouWare's cloud backend infrastructure that gives your project complete backend capabilities — including data storage, user authentication, server-side logic, and file management — all without deploying or maintaining your own servers.

Simply describe what you need in natural language, and YouWare automatically generates the frontend and backend code, then runs it in the cloud for you. YouBase provides managed hosting, compute, and storage that scales on demand, from your first prototype to millions of users.

**YouBase runs on YouWare-managed cloud infrastructure under your project's domain** (including custom domains), so you get enterprise-grade reliability without the complexity.

---

## In Simple Terms

**YouBase is your app's "brain," "vault," and "cash register"** — it remembers who your users are (authentication), remembers what they do (data storage), and can even handle payments for you.

<Tip>
**YouBase is available by default** in your workspace. When your project needs backend functionality (such as user authentication or file storage), YouWare will prompt you to enable YouBase.
</Tip>

## Setup for Existing Projects

For projects created **before the YouBase 1.0 release (December 15, 2025)**, enabling YouBase depends on your project type:

### Projects Without Legacy YouWare Backend

- The YouBase tab displays a **"Set up YouBase"** button
- Clicking it prompts you to upgrade your project to the latest version
- After upgrading, you gain access to:
  - YouBase features (Database, Users, Functions, Storage)
  - Independent and custom domain support

<Warning>
If your project uses AI API (MCP) features, those features will stop working after the upgrade.
</Warning>

### Projects With Legacy YouWare Backend

- The new Agent is **not compatible** with projects using the legacy YouWare Backend
- Automatic migration to YouBase is **not available** for these projects
- These projects will continue to work with the legacy database UI

<Warning>
**Projects using the legacy YouWare Backend cannot be automatically migrated to YouBase.** The new Agent cannot remove the legacy backend configuration from existing projects.

If you want to use YouBase with your existing project code, the only solution is to:
1. Download your project code from the legacy project
2. **Stop using the legacy backend project** - do not continue with it
3. Create a new project with YouBase enabled
4. Upload your downloaded code to the new YouBase-enabled project

This ensures your project uses YouBase instead of the deprecated legacy backend.

For assistance with this migration process, contact [support@youware.com](mailto:support@youware.com)
</Warning>

## For New Projects

Projects created **after the YouBase 1.0 release**:

- Cannot enable the legacy YouWare Backend or AI API
- Use YouBase for all backend functionality

<Info>
Existing projects already using the legacy YouWare Backend or AI API can continue using those features indefinitely.
</Info>
