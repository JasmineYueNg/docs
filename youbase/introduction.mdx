# What is YouBase?

**YouBase is YouWare's built-in cloud backend infrastructure** — think of it as the backend that powers your application.

If YouWare's visual interface is your app's "face", then YouBase is its "brain" and "memory". Without YouBase, your app is just a pretty picture: forms can't save data, users can't log in, and nothing persists. **With YouBase enabled, your app can actually "remember" user data and display personalized content for each person.**

---

## Overview

YouBase is YouWare's cloud backend infrastructure that gives your project complete backend capabilities — including data storage, user authentication, server-side logic, and file management.

Simply describe what you need in natural language, and YouWare automatically generates the frontend and backend code, then runs it in the cloud for you. YouBase provides managed hosting, compute, and storage that scales on demand, from your first prototype to millions of users.

**YouBase runs on YouWare-managed cloud infrastructure under your project's domain** (including custom domains), so you get enterprise-grade reliability without the complexity.

<Tip>
**YouBase requires a [Pro or Ultra plan](https://www.youware.com/subscription?location=docs).** When your project needs backend functionality (such as user authentication or file storage), YouWare will prompt you to upgrade and enable YouBase.
</Tip>

## Setup for Existing Projects

For projects created **before the YouBase beta (December 16, 2025)**, enabling YouBase depends on your project type:

### Projects Without YouWare Backend MCP

- The YouBase tab displays a **"Set up YouBase"** button
- Clicking it prompts you to update your project to the latest version
- After updating, you gain access to:
  - YouBase features (Database, Users, Functions, Storage)
  - Independent and custom domain support

<Warning>
If your project uses AI API (MCP) features, those features will stop working after the update.
</Warning>

### Projects With YouWare Backend MCP

- These projects can **continue to work normally** with the legacy database UI
- The new Agent is **not compatible** with YouWare Backend MCP projects
- **YouBase cannot be enabled** on these projects

<Warning>
**Projects using the YouWare Backend MCP cannot use YouBase.** The new Agent cannot work alongside the legacy backend configuration.

You have two options:

1. **Keep using the legacy backend** - Continue with your current YouWare Backend project as it is. It will keep working indefinitely.

2. **Switch to YouBase** - If you want to use YouBase features, you need to:
   - Download your project code from the legacy project
   - Delete all contents in the `backend` directory from the downloaded code
   - Re-upload the code to a new project and let Agent re-implement backend features using YouBase

There is no way to automatically migrate or convert a legacy backend project to YouBase.

For assistance, contact [support@youware.com](mailto:support@youware.com)
</Warning>

## For New Projects

Projects created **after the YouBase beta**:

- Cannot enable the YouWare Backend MCP or AI API
- Use YouBase for all backend functionality

<Info>
Existing projects already using the YouWare Backend MCP or AI API can continue using those features indefinitely.
</Info>
