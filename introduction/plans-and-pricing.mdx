## How Credits Work

Credits are your creative currency on YouWare—every AI action uses Credits based on task complexity.

### What Are Credits?

YouWare Credits power all AI-driven actions on our platform:
- **AI generation** - Creating projects from prompts
- **Feature building** - Adding functionality with natural language
- **Visual changes** - UI adjustments powered by AI

<Info>
**Different models, different costs:** You can choose lighter models for quick tasks or powerful models (like Claude Sonnet) for complex projects.
</Info>
