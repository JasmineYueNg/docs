## Why We Built This

Creativity needs freedom, not fear.

But we kept hearing the same story: **"I wanted to try something bold, but I was afraid of wasting credits."**

You'd iterate. Try different prompts. Refine your work. But every attempt felt risky. Even after multiple tries, results sometimes still missed the mark.

The frustration wasn't about tokens. **It was about losing momentum. Losing confidence.**

The system was limiting creativity. We wanted a built-in safety net that keeps confidence high.

So we asked ourselves:

<Card title="What if you could create fearlessly?" icon="lightbulb">
What if when things go wrong, you don't lose anything?
</Card>

That's why we built **Credit Care**.

<Card color="#DCFCE7" icon="shield">
**Safety first.** Credit Care catches missteps so your momentum stays intact.
</Card>

## What Is Credit Care?

Your built-in safety net.

When AI misses the mark, **rewind the attempt and restore every credit instantly.** Your progress stays protected.

### How Many Restores Do You Get?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Free Plan" icon="gift">
    **1 Restore** / month
    
    Try it out
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pro Plan ($20)" icon="star">
    **30 Restores** / month
    
    Create actively
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ultra Plan ($60)" icon="crown">
    **100 Restores** / month
    
    Build fearlessly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Think of each restore as a **creative do-over**. Test. Retry. Perfect. No stress.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create with AI">
    Build your project. Try ideas. Iterate freely.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Result Not Great?">
    Click **Rewind to previous version** on your commit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Refund">
    Select **Rewind & refund credits**. See how many chances you have left.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Done">
    Project rewinds. Credits snap back instantly—so the next experiment starts with full confidence.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Check your wallet history anytime. See all refunds. Track remaining chances.
</Tip>

## Zero-Cost Rewinds

Sometimes your commit uses **0 credits** — like when you edit code manually or tweak UI directly.

<Info>
**These are free.**

Zero-cost rewinds don't count toward your monthly limit. Rewind as much as you want.
</Info>

Fair and simple. You're only protected when you need it.
