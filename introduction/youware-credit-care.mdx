## What Is YouWare Credit Care?

YouWare Credit Care lets you refund Credits when AI-generated results don't meet your needs. Each subscription plan includes monthly Credit Restore allowances.

<Info>
**Key Feature:** Rewind to a previous version and restore all Credits used in that commit — instantly.
</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create with AI">
    Build your project. Generate content, iterate on designs, or edit code with AI assistance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Not Satisfied?">
    Click **Rewind to previous version** on your commit history.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restore Credits">
    Select **Rewind & refund Credits**. Your remaining Credit Restore balance will be shown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete">
    Your project reverts to the selected version. Credits are refunded instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** Restoring to a previous version is permanent. You will lose all versions after the selected restore point. Credits used in those later versions are **not** refunded.
</Warning>

## Special Case: Zero-Cost Rewinds

Sometimes your commit uses **0 Credits** (like manual code edits or UI tweaks).

**In these cases, Rewind doesn't count toward your monthly Credit Restore limit.**

You can rewind freely without affecting your allowance.

<Info>
Manual edits that consume 0 Credits can be rewound without using your Credit Restore allowance.
</Info>

## Check Your Balance

Track your remaining Credit Restores:

1. Open **Account Settings**
2. Navigate to **Wallet** or **Credits** section
3. View **Credit Restore Balance**

All Credit refunds are logged in your wallet history for transparency.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of Credit Restores?">
    You can still use the Rewind feature to restore previous versions, but Credits won't be refunded. Your Credit Restore allowance resets monthly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do unused Credit Restores roll over?">
    No. Credit Restore allowances reset at the start of each billing cycle and don't accumulate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I restore Credits from multiple commits at once?">
    No. Each Rewind refunds Credits from one commit only. If you restore to an earlier version, Credits from multiple intermediate commits are lost permanently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my commit used 0 Credits?">
    Commits using 0 Credits (manual edits) don't require Credit Restores. Rewind as many times as needed without affecting your monthly allowance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know how many Credits will be refunded?">
    Before confirming a Rewind, you'll see exactly how many Credits will be restored. The amount depends on what the AI generated in that commit.
