## YouWare Fundamentals

- **Full-Stack Application** — An app that includes the frontend, backend, and data layer.  
  *In YouWare:* Every project can be production-ready, not just a landing page.
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** — The leanest version of your product that solves a real problem.  
  *In YouWare:* Launch fast, learn from users, and iterate with AI instead of building infrastructure first.
- **AI API** — A YouWare-built application that exposes AI capabilities (chatbots, assistants, generators) via API.  
  *In YouWare:* Embed AI into any workflow or external product in minutes.
- **Credits** — The usage-based currency for AI generation, compute, and advanced services.  
  *In YouWare:* Pay only for what you use. Credits fuel tasks like code generation, publishing, and model upgrades.
- **Remix** — Starting from an existing project and tailoring it to your needs.  
  *In YouWare:* Duplicate any public build, tweak it, and ship your version instantly.
- **Tab Tab Prompt Completion** — Inline prompt suggestions that appear when you hit `Tab` twice.  
  *In YouWare:* Finish prompts faster with context-aware completions that reduce typing.
- **Boost** — An AI-powered enhancement that polishes existing blocks or components.  
  *In YouWare:* Quickly improve layout, copy, or visuals without rebuilding from scratch.
- **Visual Editing** — Point-and-click editing mode for adjusting layout, spacing, and styles.  
  *In YouWare:* Make precise UI tweaks without writing CSS; perfect for fine-tuning generated pages.
- **Code View** — The full source editor with syntax highlighting and AI assistance.  
  *In YouWare:* Jump into the code when you need granular control or want to add custom logic.
- **Creator Studio** — The workspace for managing projects, assets, and team members.  
  *In YouWare:* Centralize everything related to your builds in one dashboard.
- **YouWare Backend** — Managed backend services for data, auth, and automation.  
  *In YouWare:* Configure tables, triggers, and functions visually—no manual server setup required.

## AI Concepts

- **Prompt** — The instruction you give the AI to describe what you want built or changed.  
  *In YouWare:* Treat prompts like you’re briefing a full-stack teammate—clarity and detail unlock the best results.
- **Generative AI** — Technology that creates new content (text, code, images) from patterns it has learned.  
  *In YouWare:* It powers every “describe it, ship it” workflow across the platform.
- **Context Window** — The amount of information an AI model can remember while responding.  
  *In YouWare:* Long discussions stay on track because the AI keeps earlier instructions inside the window.
- **Prompt Engineering** — Crafting precise instructions that produce reliable AI outputs.  
  *In YouWare:* The better your prompt, the fewer retries you need.
- **Token** — A slice of text the AI processes (roughly a word or part of a word).  
  *In YouWare:* Complex requests that use more tokens may cost more Credits.
- **Hallucination** — When an AI generates output that’s incorrect or unsupported.  
  *In YouWare:* Nudge the AI with a follow-up prompt or use Credit Care to rewind.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** — The brains behind the responses, trained on massive datasets.  
  *In YouWare:* Switch between models like GPT‑4, Claude, or Gemini depending on speed or fidelity needs.
- **Text-to-Image Generation** — Turning written descriptions into visuals.  
  *In YouWare:* Generate custom artwork and UI assets through Image Generator or the AI API.

## Building Blocks & Workflow

- **Component** — A reusable chunk of UI such as a button, card, or form.  
  *In YouWare:* Edit Components in isolation without breaking the rest of the page.
- **Block** — A larger section composed of multiple Components (hero, testimonials, pricing).  
  *In YouWare:* Prompts often output Blocks you can rearrange or save as favorites.
- **Frontend** — Everything the user sees and interacts with in the browser.  
  *In YouWare:* Generated with modern best practices, responsive by default.
- **Backend** — The logic layer that handles data, automation, and security.  
  *In YouWare:* Auto-configured services manage auth, APIs, and workflows for you.
- **Database** — Structured storage for content, user data, or transactions.  
  *In YouWare:* Manage data from the dashboard without writing SQL.
- **Deployment** — Publishing your project to the web.  
  *In YouWare:* One click to go from draft to live—Supabase and Vercel integrations included.
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** — A coding workspace with editor, tools, and previews.  
  *In YouWare:* Use the browser editor or the VS Code / Cursor plugin to work locally.
- **Repository (Repo)** — The version-controlled home for your source code.  
  *In YouWare:* Connect GitHub to sync every commit and collaborate safely.
- **Version Control** — Tracking changes so you can revert or review history.  
  *In YouWare:* GitHub backup plus YouWare History keeps every iteration recoverable.
- **Tech Stack** — The languages, frameworks, and tools behind your project.  
  *In YouWare:* Auto-detected when you upload code, so setup is instant.
- **Authentication (Auth)** — Verifying users before granting access.  
  *In YouWare:* Built-in auth handles sign-up, login, and sessions out of the box.
- **Edge Functions** — Serverless logic that runs close to the user for low latency.  
  *In YouWare:* Use them for triggers like notifications, counters, or custom automation.
- **Real-time Updates** — Data that appears instantly without refreshing the page.  
  *In YouWare:* Perfect for live dashboards, chat, and multiplayer experiences.

## Design & Experience

- **User Flow** — The path a visitor follows to accomplish a goal.  
  *Why it matters:* Smooth flows keep users engaged and confident.
- **Responsive Design** — Layouts that adapt automatically to every screen size.  
  *Why it matters:* Every YouWare project ships responsive by default.
- **Wireframe** — A low-fidelity layout to explore structure before visual design.  
  *Why it matters:* Collect feedback early, then iterate with AI.
- **CTA (Call to Action)** — Copy or buttons that nudge users to take the next step.  
  *Why it matters:* Clear CTAs drive conversions, so YouWare places them for you.
- **Pixel-Perfect** — Code that matches the design exactly, down to spacing and colors.
