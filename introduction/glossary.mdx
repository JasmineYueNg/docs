</Info>

## üöÄ Core Concepts

Essential ideas that power the YouWare platform and enable rapid AI application development.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt" icon="message-circle">
    The text instruction or request you give the AI to tell it exactly what to build or change.

    **In YouWare:** Think of this as talking to your personal, full-stack engineer. A clear, detailed prompt (e.g., "Create a landing page for a coffee shop with a hero image and a 'View Menu' button") is the first and most important step to getting your results quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full-Stack Application" icon="layers">
    A complete software application that includes everything: the user-facing part (Frontend), the data storage (Database), and the logic that runs behind the scenes (Backend).

    **In YouWare:** YouWare helps you build the entire app, not just the front page. It's a complete, working application that can handle user accounts, forms, and data‚Äîall in one place, so you can launch faster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MVP (Minimum Viable Product)" icon="rocket">
    A version of a new product with just enough core features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development.

    **In YouWare:** If you're a founder or entrepreneur, YouWare is the fastest way to build and launch your MVP. Focus on your core idea, and let YouWare handle the rest of the technical setup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI App" icon="brain">
    A software application built with YouWare that uses generative AI as a core feature, such as a chatbot, a content generator, or a custom image tool.

    **In YouWare:** YouWare is built for the AI age. You can easily embed powerful AI features into your projects, instantly turning a simple website into a smart, interactive tool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API (Application Programming Interface)" icon="plug">
    A set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It's the "messenger" for data.

    **In YouWare:** If you want your website to connect to an external service (like a payment processor, a CRM, or even another AI model), you'll use an API. YouWare handles these complex integrations for you so you don't have to worry about the code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credits" icon="coins">
    The unit of currency used within the YouWare platform to pay for AI generation, compute time, and other advanced services.

    **In YouWare:** Credits ensure you only pay for what you use. They are consumed when you generate code, run complex AI tasks, or deploy your application. It's our way of keeping things fair and flexible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure & Workflow

Understanding how YouWare projects are organized and how components work together.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Component" icon="box">
    A reusable, self-contained piece of the user interface (UI), such as a button, a navigation bar, a contact form, or a pricing table.

    **In YouWare:** YouWare generates your website by assembling many Components. This means you can easily edit the look and feel of a single Component without affecting the rest of the site.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Block" icon="layout-grid">
    A larger, more complex section of a webpage, often made up of multiple smaller Components. Examples include a "Hero Section" or a "Testimonial Section."

    **In YouWare:** A Block is often generated by your prompt to structure a whole page. You can rearrange, edit, or save your favorite Blocks to reuse across different projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Frontend" icon="monitor">
    The part of the website the user sees and directly interacts with in their browser. It includes all the visual elements, such as colors, layouts, buttons, and images.

    **In YouWare:** This is the "face" of your website. YouWare uses modern web technologies to build a fast, beautiful, and responsive Frontend that looks great on every screen.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend" icon="server">
    The "behind the scenes" part of the application that handles data storage, security, and logic. It's what communicates with the Database and server.

    **In YouWare:** If your website needs to handle user logins, process forms, or send emails, the Backend does the heavy lifting. YouWare automatically sets this up for you securely.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database" icon="database">
    An organized collection of data that the website uses. For an e-commerce site, this would store product details, customer information, and orders.

    **In YouWare:** If your YouWare project includes a Database, you can store your important information securely. You can manage and view your data right inside the YouWare workspace‚Äîno complicated code required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deployment" icon="upload-cloud">
    The process of publishing your finished website or application so it is live and accessible to the public on the internet.

    **In YouWare:** YouWare handles this process instantly. With a single click, your work is live and ready to share on a hosting platform (like Supabase or Vercel). Go from idea to live app in minutes!

## ü§ñ AI & Automation

Understanding the intelligent features that make YouWare powerful and efficient.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generative AI" icon="sparkles">

    **In YouWare:** YouWare's core is Generative AI. It's what allows you to describe an app in plain English and have it instantly created. It's your partner in creation, not just a tool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Window" icon="frame">
    The amount of information (in words or tokens) that the AI can remember and consider when generating the next response or code.

    **In YouWare:** If your prompt is very long or you have a long conversation with YouWare, the Context Window ensures the AI remembers all the details of your project. It keeps the conversation going without forgetting your previous instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt Engineering" icon="edit-3">
    The art and science of writing effective instructions (Prompts) for an AI model to get the best possible output.

    **In YouWare:** This is your superpower in YouWare. Learning to write clear, specific prompts means you get the exact website, feature, or code you need on the first try, saving you time and effort.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token" icon="hash">
    The basic unit of data (like a word or part of a word) that the AI uses to process information. The Context Window is measured in Tokens.

    **In YouWare:** You don't need to worry about the exact number, but understanding that the AI processes your prompts in Tokens helps explain why very complex requests may cost more Credits. It's the digital fuel that powers the AI's understanding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hallucination" icon="alert-triangle">
    When an AI model generates output that is factually incorrect, nonsensical, or not supported by its training data.

    **In YouWare:** Even smart AI can sometimes "Hallucinate." This is why the human element is important‚Äîyou can quickly correct the AI with a new Prompt, guiding it back on track.
