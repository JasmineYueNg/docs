</Info>

## üöÄ Core Concepts

Essential ideas that power the YouWare platform and enable rapid AI application development.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt" icon="text">
    The text instruction or request you give the AI to tell it exactly what to build or change.

    **In YouWare:** Think of this as talking to your personal, full-stack engineer. A clear, detailed prompt (e.g., "Create a landing page for a coffee shop with a hero image and a 'View Menu' button") is the first and most important step to getting your results quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full-Stack Application" icon="layers">
    A complete software application that includes everything: the user-facing part (Frontend), the data storage (Database), and the logic that runs behind the scenes (Backend).

    **In YouWare:** YouWare helps you build the entire app, not just the front page. It's a complete, working application that can handle user accounts, forms, and data‚Äîall in one place, so you can launch faster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MVP (Minimum Viable Product)" icon="rocket">
    A version of a new product with just enough core features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development.

    **In YouWare:** If you're a founder or entrepreneur, YouWare is the fastest way to build and launch your MVP. Focus on your core idea, and let YouWare handle the rest of the technical setup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI App" icon="brain">
    A software application built with YouWare that uses generative AI as a core feature, such as a chatbot, a content generator, or a custom image tool.

    **In YouWare:** YouWare is built for the AI age. You can easily embed powerful AI features into your projects, instantly turning a simple website into a smart, interactive tool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API (Application Programming Interface)" icon="plug">
    A set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It's the "messenger" for data.

    **In YouWare:** If you want your website to connect to an external service (like a payment processor, a CRM, or even another AI model), you'll use an API. YouWare handles these complex integrations for you so you don't have to worry about the code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credits" icon="dollar-sign">
    The unit of currency used within the YouWare platform to pay for AI generation, compute time, and other advanced services.

    **In YouWare:** Credits ensure you only pay for what you use. They are consumed when you generate code, run complex AI tasks, or deploy your application. It's our way of keeping things fair and flexible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MCP (Model Context Protocol)" icon="puzzle-piece">
    A standardized way for AI applications to connect with external tools and services. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets your AI talk to other software.

    **In YouWare:** MCP Tools are pre-built integrations (like Figma, Notion, GitHub) that extend your project's capabilities. Just enable the tool you need, and YouWare handles all the technical connection work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration" icon="link">
    Connecting different software applications or services so they can work together and share data, like linking puzzle pieces to create a complete picture.

    **In YouWare:** Integrations (via MCP Tools) let your project connect to services like Notion, Figma, Supabase, and more‚Äîturning separate tools into a unified, powerful development environment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remix" icon="shuffle">
    Taking an existing project and modifying it to create your own version, building on someone else's work rather than starting from scratch.

    **In YouWare:** The Remix feature lets you open any public project, make changes to it, and save your own customized version‚Äîperfect for learning, iterating on designs, or adapting templates to your needs.
