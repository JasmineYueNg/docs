## Step 1: Create Your First Project (~2min)

The journey starts with the Creative Command Center, where you simply describe your idea.

**Two Paths to Power: Build or Remix**

YouWare gives you the flexibility to start from scratch or build upon the community's best work.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Build from Scratch">
    <Card title="Path 1: Build from Scratch (The Visionary Path)" icon="zap">
      Best for original ideas, learning the full workflow, or projects requiring custom architecture.
      
      **How to Start:**
      
      1. **Describe your idea clearly:**

      <Tip>
      **üí° Pro Tips for Better Results:**
      - Keep it tight and actionable (e.g., "add dark mode and a settings page")
      - Mention concrete features (e.g., "search by tag," "export to CSV," "image upload")
      - Call out key features (e.g., "dark mode toggle," "responsive design")
      </Tip>

      ```text Example Prompts
      ‚úÖ Good: "Create a recipe sharing app with search, user profiles,
               and the ability to save favorites"
               
      ‚ùå Too vague: "Make a cooking app"
      ‚ùå Too long: [lengthy descriptions]
      ```

      2. **Press "Enter"** or click the generate button
      3. **Watch YouWare build your project** in approximately 30 seconds
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Remix">
    <Card title="Path 2: Discover & Remix Projects (The Accelerator Path)" icon="users">
      Best for learning by example, rapid prototyping, or adapting proven concepts.
      
      **How to Start:**
      
      1. When you enter a prompt, YouWare will suggest relevant projects below the input box
      2. Browse "Projects for Your Inspiration" ‚Äî these are real-world examples from the community
      3. Click "Remix" on any project that catches your eye
         - The project is instantly copied into your workspace
         - All functionality is preserved
      4. Describe your changes in the prompt box
      5. Watch as YouWare adapts the project to your specifications

      ```text Remix Examples
      Examples:
      "Switch the color scheme to green and add a login button"
      "Replace the hero image with a video background"
      "Add a pricing table with three tiers"
      ```

      <Warning>
      **Important:** Projects started via Remix cannot be downloaded as source code. They are designed for rapid, in-platform iteration and publishing.
      </Warning>
    </Card>
  </Tab>

## Step 2: Refine Your Creation

Once YouWare generates your initial project, you have multiple ways to perfect it in the Editor.

### Chat with AI (The Conversational Editor)

<img

  alt="AI chat interface showing conversational editing capabilities"
  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)', marginBottom: '16px' }}
/>

The most powerful way to refine your project is by continuing the conversation. The AI remembers the context of your entire project and can execute complex changes instantly.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card>
    ‚úÖ "Add a dark mode toggle to the header."
    
    ‚úÖ "Make the 'Submit' button more prominent and change its color to red."
    
    ‚úÖ "Connect this form to a new database table called UserFeedback."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Visual Editing (The No-Code Layer)

  alt="Visual editing interface demonstration showing drag-and-drop functionality"
  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)', marginBottom: '16px' }}
/>

For quick style tweaks and content changes, use the Visual Editor.

- Click any element in the preview (e.g., a button, a text block, an image)

### Code View (The Developer's Playground)

<img 
  src="/images/quick-start-code-editor-view.png" 
  alt="Code editor interface showing project file structure and editing capabilities"
  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)', marginBottom: '16px' }}
/>

For deep customization, you have full access to your project's complete codebase.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Browse Your Project Structure" icon="folder">
    Open Code View to explore all generated files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) directly inside the workspace. All users can inspect the complete code architecture.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edit & Save Instantly (Subscribers)" icon="edit">
    Make changes to any file, and your edits are instantly reflected in the preview. The AI can further refine your manual code changes conversationally.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cleaner, Faster Workflow" icon="zap">
    The redesigned interface makes development and iteration more intuitive‚Äîeverything you need is connected in one workspace.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 3: Share & Publish

Your project isn't finished until it's out in the world. YouWare makes publishing effortless.

### Instant Publishing

  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)', marginBottom: '16px' }}

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Instant Deployment">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share Your Creation">
    Share this link with anyone‚Äîit's a fully functional web application!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Project Title" icon="tag">
    Change the name that appears in the browser tab and on the share card
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Cover" icon="image">
    Upload a custom image to serve as the project's thumbnail when shared
