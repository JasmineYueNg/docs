## What Are YouWare Credits?

At YouWare, we believe creativity shouldn't be limited by complexity—especially when it comes to AI. That's why we designed **YouWare Credits** as a simple, transparent system that powers everything you do on our platform.

**Credits are the universal creative currency within YouWare.**

Every time you generate code, build a website, remix a project, or use AI to bring an idea to life—Credits make it happen.

<Info>
**1 Credit = 1 unit of AI power for your imagination.**
</Info>

Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions or hidden token limits, YouWare Credits give you a clear, unified way to understand **how much creative energy you've used**, and **how much you still have to explore**.

## How Do YouWare Credits Work — and What Can You Do with Them?

Every AI action you take on YouWare—from writing code to generating visuals or refining logic—consumes a small number of Credits.

Here's how they typically work across the platform:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Coding & Debugging" icon="code">
    Generate or improve your app, logic, or website with natural-language prompts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Design Generation" icon="palette">
    Create layouts, UI components instantly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remix & Rewind" icon="rotate-left">
    Experiment with different prompts, restore previous versions, and refine results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deploy & Preview" icon="rocket">
    Publish live previews or build deployable web apps powered by AI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Each model or feature may consume Credits at a slightly different rate (for example, heavier tasks like multi-file generation or image synthesis use more).

**You can always check your exact usage in your Wallet or Creator Center**—it's fully transparent.

And if you're subscribed to a **Pro** or **Ultra** plan, your Credits are **automatically renewed every month**, along with added benefits like **YouWare Credit Care refunds** and **priority models**.

## How to Get More YouWare Credits

Running out of Credits shouldn't stop your creativity—and we make it easy to recharge.

You have three main ways to get more:

### 1. Monthly Subscription Refill

Each active plan (Free, Pro, Ultra) receives a fresh batch of Credits every month.
