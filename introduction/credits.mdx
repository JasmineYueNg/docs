<Info>
**One currency. Complete transparency.**

Credits power everything you build on YouWare—from AI generation to deployment. Simple, predictable, and fair.
</Info>

## What Are Credits?

Credits are YouWare's universal currency for AI-powered creation.

Every action that requires AI processing—generating code, creating images, or building features—uses Credits. Think of them as **creative fuel** that powers your entire workflow.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do Credits expire?" icon="calendar">
    **No.** Your Credits never expire. Use them whenever you're ready, at your own pace.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of Credits?" icon="battery-empty">
    You can't start new AI tasks, but you can still view, publish, and download your existing projects. Upgrade your plan or purchase more Credits to continue creating.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund for unused Credits?" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Credits are non-refundable, but they never expire. However, **YouWare Credit Care** lets you rewind failed attempts and recover those Credits—giving you protection when things don't work out.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I track my Credit usage?" icon="chart-line">
    Visit your **account dashboard** to see:
    - Current Credit balance
    - Usage history

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why do different models cost different Credits?" icon="scale-balanced">
    More advanced AI models (like Claude Sonnet 4.5) require more computational power, so they cost more Credits. Lighter models (like GLM 4.5) are faster and cheaper. YouWare gives you the choice—pick the right tool for each task.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I share Credits with my team?" icon="users">
