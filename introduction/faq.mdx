Welcome to YouWare! We've built YouWare to be the fastest, most intuitive way to build and deploy web applications. This comprehensive FAQ covers everything from core features to advanced development workflows.

## Getting Started: Your First Project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm a complete beginner. Where should I start after logging into YouWare?">
    We recommend heading straight to the "Create" button. You have two main paths:

    1. **Start with a simple prompt**: Describe your idea in natural language to the AI and watch it come to life.
    2. **Use a Template**: Browse curated project templates and community recommendations to kickstart instantly.

    Our template library is constantly expanding! Need inspiration? Check out the "Explore" page to see what other creators are building and trending projects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 'Create' and 'Upload' a project?">
    - **"Create"** is for starting fresh, either by prompting the AI or using a YouWare template. Perfect for new ideas and rapid prototyping.
    - **"Upload"** is for importing existing project files (HTML/CSS/JS) to manage, share, or continue developing in YouWare.

    **For beginners:** Create is the easiest way to dive in!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a 'remix,' and how does it work?">
    A "remix" lets you instantly copy another creator's public project to your own workspace. Think of it as **making your own version of someone else's work**—like taking a recipe and adjusting it to your taste.

    **What you get:**

    - Full, editable copy in your workspace
    - Learn from and modify existing work
    - Build upon others' projects safely
    - Original project remains unaffected

    <Note>
      Creators can manage and share their templates through the **Creator Studio**.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I change my project's name and cover image?">
    You can manage these settings within the project editor. Look for the "Setting" menu, typically located in the top-left corner of the interface. This menu provides options to update the project title and select a new cover image for better organization and presentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="If I create a project from someone else's template, will I be charged Credits?">
    No, creating a project from others' project is free. Credits are only deducted when you formally input a query and the AI executes a task (i.e., generates or modifies code).

    You are charged for the computational resources used by the AI Agent, not for simply copying a template. We also offer Credit Rewards for platform participation and task completion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What file formats are supported for project upload?">
    We support a wide range of common document and code formats:

    **Documents**: `.doc`, `.docx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.txt`, `.epub`, `.csv`

    **Code**: Static web files (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, etc.)

    <Note>
      For compressed files, please unzip the archive first and upload the entire project folder.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Core Development & Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I edit content (text, images, components) in my project?">
    Once YouWare generates your initial project, you have **three powerful ways** to refine and edit it:

    ### 1. Chat with AI (The Conversational Editor)

    The most powerful way to refine your project. Simply tell the AI what you want to change using natural language. The AI remembers the context of your entire project and can execute complex changes instantly.

    **Examples:**

    - "Add a dark mode toggle to the header"
    - "Make the 'Submit' button more prominent and change its color to red"
    - "Connect this form to a new database table called UserFeedback"

    ### 2. Visual Editing (The No-Code Layer)

    For quick style tweaks and content changes. Click any element in the preview (e.g., a button, a text block, an image) and make direct visual adjustments without writing code. Perfect for rapid prototyping and design iterations.

    ### 3. Code View (The Developer's Playground)

    For deep customization with full access to your project's complete code:

    - **Browse Your Project Structure**: Explore all generated files directly inside the workspace
    - **Edit & Save Instantly (Subscribers)**: Make changes to any file with instant preview reflection
    - **Cleaner, Faster Workflow**: The redesigned interface makes development more intuitive

    <Tip>
      All three methods work seamlessly together, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow and expertise level.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a landing page or a specific component?">
    Just prompt the AI with a clear description of what you need. Be specific!

    **Examples:**

    - "Create a product landing page for an AI-powered tool, using a clean, modern design."
    - "Add a sticky navigation bar with three links: Home, Features, and Pricing."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does YouWare support full-stack development (backend and database)?">
    ### YouBase — Built-in Backend Infrastructure

    **YouBase** is YouWare's integrated backend solution. It provides everything you need for full-stack development without external services:

    - **Users & Authentication**: Email login, Google OAuth, and temporary accounts
    - **Database**: Create and manage tables with simple prompts
    - **Storage**: File uploads and media management
    - **Secrets**: Secure API key storage

    ### How to Use

    YouBase is built into every YouWare project. Simply describe your backend needs to the Agent:

    - *"Add user login to my app"*
    - *"Create a database table for storing user feedback"*
    - *"Let users upload profile pictures"*

    ### Deployment

    **Cloud Deploy**: One-click publishing deploys both your frontend and YouBase backend together seamlessly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I integrate external APIs or libraries into my project?">
    <Warning>
      **Important Security Note**: If you integrate external APIs without using YouBase Secrets, there is a **risk of API key exposure** in your front-end code.
    </Warning>
    **YouBase Secrets**: Store your API keys securely in YouBase Secrets. They are never exposed in the front-end code.

    **Best Practice**: For sensitive API integrations, always use YouBase Secrets to store API keys securely, rather than exposing them in client-side code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I view the code or download it?">
    Yes, code visibility and ownership are core to our professional ethos.

    **Viewing Code**: You can inspect the generated code at any time within the editor. Full transparency guaranteed.

    **Downloading Code**: This is a YouWare Pro exclusive feature, designed for professional users who need to integrate their work into external development tools or hosting platforms.

    <Warning>
      To protect community creators, code download is only available for projects you created from scratch (non-Remix projects).
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Workflow & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I write effective prompts to get the best results?">
    Think of the AI as a highly skilled, but literal, colleague. The key to great results is to be **Clear, Specific, and Contextual**.

    ### Golden Rules from Prompt Craft

    1. **Start with the Feeling, Not the Features**: Describe the *vibe* you want (e.g., "cozy, rainy-day bookstore" vs. "three-column layout")
    2. **Tell a Story**: Structure your site like chapters—Hook, Why, Proof, Invitation
    3. **Sculpt, Don't Command**: Treat prompting as a conversation. Refine piece by piece.

    **Examples:**
    - ❌ "Make a landing page for a fitness app"
    - ✅ "The vibe should be energetic and motivating, but not intimidating. Think bright colors, bold fonts, and a feeling of momentum."

    <Tip>
      Check out the [Prompt Craft](/prompting/prompting) guide for a complete masterclass on talking to AI like an art director, not a mechanic.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the 'TabTab' feature?">
    TabTab is your efficiency booster. While you are typing a prompt, press the **Tab key** to trigger an AI-powered auto-complete suggestion. It helps you articulate complex commands faster and discover new ways to interact with the tool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I debug or check what went wrong with my project?">
    As a professional tool, we encourage you to use standard web development diagnostics:

    - **Browser Console (F12)**: Press F12 to open your browser's developer console. This is your first line of defense to distinguish between client-side and platform-side errors
    - **Error Messages**: If the project fails to run, the system will provide a specific error message. Read it carefully and cross-reference with our documentation

    ![Browser console showing debugging information for YouWare projects](/images/browser-console-debug.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I get a 500 error or a capacity limit message?">
    A **500 error** is typically a server-side issue. First, try refreshing the page or starting a new chat session.

    If the problem persists, please email us immediately at [**support@youware.com**](mailto:support@youware.com) with:

    1. The project link
    2. A screenshot of the error message (and the F12 console if possible)

    <Info>
      If you hit a capacity limit, it means our servers are temporarily under high load. We're scaling up rapidly! Please try again in a few minutes.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## YouBase — Backend & Full-Stack Development

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is YouBase and what does it provide?">
    **YouBase** is YouWare's built-in backend infrastructure. It provides four core modules:

    - **Users & Authentication**: Email login, Google OAuth, temporary accounts, and user management
    - **Database**: Create tables, store data, and query records with simple prompts
    - **Storage**: Upload and manage files (images, documents, media)
    - **Secrets**: Securely store API keys and sensitive configuration

    <Info>
      YouBase is a unified, self-developed solution—auth + database + storage + secrets all working together seamlessly. No external services required.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I build apps with databases and user authentication?">
    Simply describe your needs to the Agent. YouBase handles the implementation automatically.

    **Example prompts:**
    - *"Add user login with email and Google"*
    - *"Create a database table for blog posts with title, content, and author"*
    - *"Let users upload profile pictures"*
    - *"Store my OpenAI API key securely"*

    **Example:** Create a voting app by describing: *"Create a voting app with user login. Store poll options and vote counts in the database. Show real-time results."*
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Supabase or other external databases?">
    Yes! While YouBase is the recommended default (zero configuration, works instantly), you can also connect **Supabase** via MCP by providing valid access keys and describing your data goals to the Agent.

    **Recommendation:** Use YouBase for most projects—it's simpler and fully integrated. Use Supabase if you need specific features or prefer external control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What real-world projects can I build with YouBase?">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Voting Systems">
        Build real-time polls where results update instantly. Store vote counts and voter IDs, automatically calculate percentages.

    You get a generous free tier to start building before any costs apply.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations & External Services

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are MCP Tools and how do I use them?">
    **MCP Tools** are like apps for your website. Install one, and your project connects to services you already use—ChatGPT, Figma, Notion, GitHub, and more.

    **To add an integration:**
    1. Click the **MCP icon** in the sidebar
    2. Browse available tools (Figma, Notion, GitHub, etc.)
    3. Enable the tools you want
    4. Describe what you need in natural language

    **Examples:**
    - "Pull my latest Notion pages and display them here"
    - "Convert my Figma design into a live webpage"
    - "Connect to ChatGPT for real-time conversations"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I integrate AI models into my website (chatbots, image generators)?">
    Use the **AI API** tool to give your website access to specialized AI services. This is different from the AI that builds your website—it enables your *finished website* to perform AI tasks for end users.

    **What you can build:**
    - Chatbots that answer questions in real-time
    - Image generators for users to create custom artwork
    - Sentiment analysis tools
    - Video creation platforms
    - Text summarization tools

    **Key Benefits:**
    - No API key management (we handle it securely)
    - Simple pricing in YouWare Credits
    - Access to models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and more

    <Warning>
      The AI API is for your website to call AI models, not for building your website. Use YouWare's core AI to build the website structure, then use AI API to add smart functionality.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect my GitHub repository to YouWare?">
    Yes! The **GitHub Integration** allows you to:
    - Connect to your GitHub project for automatic backup and history tracking
    - Let the AI read your existing code to understand your style and project structure
    - Generate code that perfectly matches your existing work
    - Enable team collaboration with code reviews and task tracking

    **Setup:** Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token, add the integration, and the AI will understand your entire project context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I integrate an external API without using YouBase Secrets?">
    <Warning>
      **Security Risk**: API keys exposed in front-end code can be compromised.
    </Warning>

    **Best Practice**: Always use **YouBase Secrets** to store API keys securely. This keeps sensitive credentials safe and prevents exposure in client-side code.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tech Stack & Developer Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between React and HTML modes?">
    **YouWare uses React as the default for 0-1 creation.** Here's why:

    ### Why React by Default?

    - **Better Results**: React's component architecture helps AI generate more organized, maintainable code
    - **Modern Stack**: Industry-standard framework used by professional developers
    - **Dynamic Features**: State management and interactivity work seamlessly out of the box
    - **Reusable Components**: Easier to iterate and scale your project

    ### When to Use Each Mode

    | | **React Mode (Default)** | **HTML Mode** |
    |---|---|---|
    | **Best for** | Full apps, dashboards, interactive sites | Simple landing pages, static sites |
    | **AI Performance** | Better structure, cleaner code generation | Straightforward, minimal setup |
    | **Switching** | Default for new projects | Type `/html_mode` to switch |
    | **Upload** | Upload React projects directly | Upload HTML/CSS/JS files |
    | **Learning curve** | Modern framework (AI handles complexity) | Simpler, traditional approach |

    <Info>
      **Good news:** You don't need to know React to use YouWare! The AI handles all the technical details. Just describe what you want in plain language.
    </Info>

    **Pro tip:** Stick with React for most projects—the AI generates better results. Only switch to HTML if you specifically need a minimal static site or have existing HTML code to upload.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use YouWare with my IDE (VS Code, Cursor)?">
    **Yes!** Official plugins are available for:
    - **VS Code**
    - **Cursor** (powered by Claude)

    **What you can do:**
    - Publish projects to YouWare directly from your editor
    - Retrieve shareable project links instantly
    - Access YouWare projects without leaving your IDE

    This makes it seamless to integrate YouWare into professional development workflows.

    - Single file: Up to 100MB on creation page
    - Total per project: 500MB storage included

    <Tip>
      For compressed files, unzip first and upload the complete folder structure.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Planning & Optimization Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Plan Mode and when should I use it?">
    **Plan Mode** (`/plan`) is for organizing ideas *before* execution. It lets you:

    1. **Outline your vision**: Describe what you want to build
    2. **Organize steps**: Break complex projects into manageable phases
    3. **Get structured planning**: The AI helps you think through your approach
    4. **Then build**: Once your plan is solid, execute step by step

    **Best uses:**
    - Complex multi-step projects (e-commerce sites, dashboards)
    - Team collaboration (align on approach before coding)
    - Exploratory phases (brainstorm without committing to execution)

    **Benefit:** Lightweight planning prevents wasted edits and keeps early brainstorming efficient.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I stop a generation or task that's running?">
    **Yes!** The **Stop button** lets you:
    - Interrupt ongoing generation immediately
