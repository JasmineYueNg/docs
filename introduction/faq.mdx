Welcome to YouWare! We've built YouWare to be the fastest, most intuitive way to build and deploy web applications. This comprehensive FAQ covers everything from core features to advanced development workflows.

## Getting Started: Your First Project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm a complete beginner. Where should I start after logging into YouWare?">
    We recommend heading straight to the "Create" button. You have two main paths:

    1. **Start with a simple prompt**: Describe your idea in natural language to the AI and watch it come to life.
    2. **Use a Template**: Browse curated project templates and community recommendations to kickstart instantly.

    Our template library is constantly expanding! Need inspiration? Check out the "Explore" page to see what other creators are building and trending projects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 'Create' and 'Upload' a project?">
    - **"Create"** is for starting fresh, either by prompting the AI or using a YouWare template. Perfect for new ideas and rapid prototyping.
    - **"Upload"** is for importing existing project files (HTML/CSS/JS) to manage, share, or continue developing in YouWare.

    **For beginners:** Create is the easiest way to dive in!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a 'remix,' and how does it work?">
    A "remix" lets you instantly duplicate another creator's public project. Think of it as **forking a public repository**.

    **What you get:**

    - Full, editable copy in your workspace
    - Learn from and modify existing work
    - Build upon others' projects safely
    - Original project remains unaffected

    <Note>
      Creators can manage and share their templates through the **Creator Studio**.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I change my project's name and cover image?">
    You can manage these settings within the project editor. Look for the "Setting" menu, typically located in the top-left corner of the interface. This menu provides options to update the project title and select a new cover image for better organization and presentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="If I create a project from someone else's template, will I be charged Credits?">
    No, creating a project from others' project is free. Credits are only deducted when you formally input a query and the AI executes a task (i.e., generates or modifies code).

    You are charged for the computational resources used by the AI Agent, not for simply copying a template. We also offer Credit Rewards for platform participation and task completion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What file formats are supported for project upload?">
    We support a wide range of common document and code formats:

    **Documents**: `.doc`, `.docx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.txt`, `.epub`, `.csv`

    **Code**: Static web files (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, etc.)

    <Note>
      For compressed files, please unzip the archive first and upload the entire project folder.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Core Development & Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I edit content (text, images, components) in my project?">
    Once YouWare generates your initial project, you have **three powerful ways** to refine and edit it:

    ### 1. Chat with AI (The Conversational Editor)

    The most powerful way to refine your project. Simply tell the AI what you want to change using natural language. The AI remembers the context of your entire project and can execute complex changes instantly.

    **Examples:**

    - "Add a dark mode toggle to the header"
    - "Make the 'Submit' button more prominent and change its color to red"
    - "Connect this form to a new database table called UserFeedback"

    ### 2. Visual Editing (The No-Code Layer)

    For quick style tweaks and content changes. Click any element in the preview (e.g., a button, a text block, an image) and make direct visual adjustments without writing code. Perfect for rapid prototyping and design iterations.

    ### 3. Code View (The Developer's Playground)

    For deep customization with full access to your project's complete codebase:

    - **Browse Your Project Structure**: Explore all generated files directly inside the workspace
    - **Edit & Save Instantly (Subscribers)**: Make changes to any file with instant preview reflection
    - **Cleaner, Faster Workflow**: The redesigned interface makes development more intuitive

    <Tip>
      All three methods work seamlessly together, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow and expertise level.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a landing page or a specific component?">
    Just prompt the AI with a clear description of what you need. Be specific!

    **Examples:**

    - "Create a product landing page for an AI-powered tool, using a clean, modern design."
    - "Add a sticky navigation bar with three links: Home, Features, and Pricing."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does YouWare support full-stack development (backend and database)?">
    ### Current Backend Support

    **Built-in Backend System**: YouWare has its own integrated backend infrastructure. You no longer need to rely solely on external services.

    **Supabase Integration**: In addition to our native backend, Supabase remains a supported toolchain option. Connect your Supabase database by providing valid access keys and clearly describing your data goals to the AI.

    **Database Management**: You can create and manage databases directly within YouWare:

    - Creating new databases through simple prompts
    - Managing tables and data structures
    - Real-time database operations

    ### Deployment

    **Cloud Deploy**: We offer a built-in deployment pipeline to simplify pushing your project live, making it easy to deploy both frontend and backend components together.

    ### Roadmap

    - Enhanced backend service capabilities
    - More advanced database management features
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I integrate external APIs or libraries into my project?">
    <Warning>
      **Important Security Note**: If you integrate external APIs without using official YouWare MCP tools, there is a **risk of API key exposure** in your front-end code.
    </Warning>
    **Official YouWare MCP Tools**: When using official YouWare MCP tools (like YouWare Backend), your API keys are stored securely in the backend and are not exposed in the front-end code.

    **Best Practice**: For sensitive API integrations, always use YouWare Backend to store API keys securely and make calls from the server side, rather than exposing them in client-side code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I view the code or download it?">
    Yes, code visibility and ownership are core to our professional ethos.

    **Viewing Code**: You can inspect the generated code at any time within the editor. Full transparency guaranteed.

    **Downloading Code**: This is a YouWare Pro exclusive feature, designed for professional users who need to integrate their work into external CI/CD pipelines or hosting environments.

    <Warning>
      To protect community creators, code download is only available for projects you created from scratch (non-Remix projects).
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Workflow & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I write effective prompts to get the best results?">
    Think of the AI as a highly skilled, but literal, colleague. The key to great results is to be **Clear, Specific, and Contextual**.

    ### Prompt Structure

    1. **Define the Goal**: Start by stating the main objective (e.g., "Build a responsive pricing table")
    2. **Set the Constraints**: Specify the tools or style (e.g., "Use Bootstrap 5, dark mode")
    3. **Provide Context**: Use clarifying terms to prevent errors (e.g., "Without affecting the existing header component")
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the 'TabTab' feature?">
    TabTab is your efficiency booster. While you are typing a prompt, press the **Tab key** to trigger an AI-powered auto-complete suggestion. It helps you articulate complex commands faster and discover new ways to interact with the tool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I debug or check what went wrong with my project?">
    As a professional tool, we encourage you to use standard web development diagnostics:

    - **Browser Console (F12)**: Press F12 to open your browser's developer console. This is your first line of defense to distinguish between client-side and platform-side errors
    - **Error Messages**: If the project fails to run, the system will provide a specific error message. Read it carefully and cross-reference with our documentation

    ![Browser console showing debugging information for YouWare projects](/images/browser-console-debug.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I get a 500 error or a capacity limit message?">
    A **500 error** is typically a server-side issue. First, try refreshing the page or starting a new chat session.

    If the problem persists, please email us immediately at [**support@youware.com**](mailto:support@youware.com) with:

    1. The project link
    2. A screenshot of the error message (and the F12 console if possible)

    <Info>
      If you hit a capacity limit, it means our servers are temporarily under high load. We're scaling up rapidly! Please try again in a few minutes.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Backend, Databases & Full-Stack Development

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I build apps with databases and user authentication?">
    **YouWare Backend** is your all-in-one solution for full-stack development. It provides:

    - **Database**: Store and retrieve data (votes, scores, comments, user profiles)
    - **User Authentication**: Real user login with YouWare accounts
    - **Edge Functions**: Automated server-side logic (calculate rankings, send notifications)

    **Example:** Create a voting app by describing: *"Create a voting app with a database storing poll options and vote counts. Deploy a function that automatically updates percentages after each vote."*

    <Info>
      Unlike other platforms that require piecing together multiple services, YouWare Backend is one unified, self-developed solution—database + auth + functions + storage all working together seamlessly.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Supabase or other external databases?">
    Yes! YouWare Backend is your default, but you can also connect **Supabase** by providing valid access keys and describing your data goals to the AI. The YouWare Backend approach requires zero configuration and works instantly—Supabase is available if you prefer external control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What real-world projects can I build with YouWare Backend?">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Voting Systems">
        Build real-time polls where results update instantly. Store vote counts and voter IDs, automatically calculate percentages.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Leaderboards">
        Create competitive scoreboards with automatic ranking calculations. Display real player names from user accounts.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Comment Threads">
        Add comment sections with persistent storage. Show real user profiles instead of "Anonymous User."
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Quiz Platforms">
        Store quiz questions, user answers, and scores. Track progress across sessions.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="User Profiles">
        Member-only areas with personalized experiences. Store user preferences and history.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much does YouWare Backend cost?">
    YouWare Backend uses your regular Credits. The cost depends on your usage:
    - **Database reads/writes**: Small credit cost per operation
    - **Function executions**: Credits deducted when functions run
    - **Storage**: If you store files or large datasets

    You get a generous free tier to start building before any costs apply.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations & External Services

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are MCP Tools and how do I use them?">
    **MCP Tools** are like apps for your website. Install one, and your project connects to services you already use—ChatGPT, Figma, Notion, GitHub, and more.

    **To add an integration:**
    1. Click the **MCP icon** in the sidebar
    2. Browse available tools (YouWare Backend, AI API, Figma, Notion, etc.)
    3. Enable the tools you want
    4. Describe what you need in natural language

    - "Pull my latest Notion pages and display them here"
    - "Convert my Figma design into a live webpage"
    - "Connect to ChatGPT for real-time conversations"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I integrate AI models into my website (chatbots, image generators)?">
    Use the **AI API** tool to give your website access to specialized AI services. This is different from the AI that builds your website—it enables your *finished website* to perform AI tasks for end users.

    **What you can build:**
    - Chatbots that answer questions in real-time
    - Image generators for users to create custom artwork
    - Sentiment analysis tools
