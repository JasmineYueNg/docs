  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}
/>

<Info>
**Two Ways to Get Started: Build New or Remix Existing**

Start from scratch with your own idea, or adapt an existing project from the community.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Build from Scratch">
    <Card title="Build Your Own Project" icon="zap">
      Best for original ideas or when you want full control.
      
      **How to Start:**
      
      1. **Describe your idea clearly in the input box:**

      <Tip>
      **üí° Tips for Better Results:**
      - Be specific about features (e.g., "search functionality," "user login," "image upload")
      - Keep descriptions concise and actionable
      - Mention key requirements upfront
      </Tip>

      ```text Example Prompts
      ‚úÖ Good: "Create a recipe sharing app with search, user profiles, 
               and the ability to save favorites"
               
      ‚ùå Too vague: "Make a cooking app"
      ```

      2. **Press "Enter"** or click the generate button
      3. **YouWare builds your project** in approximately 30 seconds
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Remix">
    <Card title="Remix an Existing Project" icon="users">
      Best for rapid prototyping or learning by example.
      
      **How to Start:**
      
      1. Enter a prompt, and YouWare shows relevant projects below the input
      2. Browse the suggested projects from the community
      3. Click "Remix" on a project you like
         - The project is instantly copied to your workspace
      4. Describe your changes
      5. YouWare adapts the project to your specifications

      ```text Remix Examples
      "Change the color scheme to green and add a login button"
      "Replace the hero image with a video background"
      "Add a pricing table with three tiers"
      ```

      <Warning>
      **Note:** Projects created via Remix cannot be downloaded as source code. They're designed for rapid in-platform iteration and publishing.

## Step 2: Edit & Refine Your Project

Once AI builds your initial project, you have multiple tools to perfect it.

### Chat with AI

  alt="AI chat interface showing conversational editing capabilities"
  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)', marginBottom: '16px' }}
/>

Continue the conversation with AI to make complex changes. The AI remembers your project context and can execute requests instantly.

    ‚úÖ "Add a dark mode toggle to the header"
    
    ‚úÖ "Make the 'Submit' button red and more prominent"
