## Voice-Driven Development

<Accordion title="On-the-Go Creation">
Got a great idea during your commute? Open the app and describe it with your voice—AI will start building immediately.

**Voice Commands**: Describe your project idea naturally and watch AI transform it into reality
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Visual Input Integration">
See an interesting image you want to use in your project? Just snap a photo and upload it—the Agent will handle the rest.

**Photo Integration**: Capture inspiration and seamlessly integrate it into your development workflow
</Accordion>

<Note>
Creation no longer requires sitting in front of a computer; your phone **is** your development environment.
</Note>

## Smart Notifications & Progress Tracking

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Background Task Management">
When the Agent is executing tasks in the background, you don't need to keep staring at the screen. Once a task is completed, the app will send you a push notification to let you know the project has been updated.

**Push Notifications**: Stay informed about project updates without constant monitoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Visual Progress Indicators">
Task reminder badges will be marked on the corresponding projects, so you can clearly see which work has been completed and which needs your feedback.

**Badge System**: Visual indicators help you track completion status at a glance
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Even while on the move, you can stay on top of all your project progress with intelligent status tracking.
