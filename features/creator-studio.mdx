## How You Earn

You earn when others use your projects and consume Credits.

**Formula:**
```
Total Credits consumed by users
→ minus platform operating costs
→ 50% of remaining converted at 100 Credits = $1 USD
```

### Example

- User consumption: 10,000 Credits
- Platform costs: 8,000 Credits
- Your share: 50% of 2,000 Credits = 1,000 Credits = **$10 USD**

<Warning>
Earnings settle daily at 03:00 AM UTC. Payouts require minimum balance of $50 USD.
