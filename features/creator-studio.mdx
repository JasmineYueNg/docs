# Creator Studio

In Creator Studio, you can view your creative performance, revenue data, and incentive earnings, managing your creative achievements and monetization progress all in one place.

## Getting Started

Creator Studio can be accessed through the profile menu in the upper right corner of the homepage: click on your avatar → select **Creator Studio**

Here, you can view usage and incentive statistics for all projects, as well as total earnings and withdrawal records.

Creator Studio is divided into two main sections:

- **Dashboard** — data overview and project performance
- **Monetization** — earnings statistics and withdrawal management

## Dashboard

Dashboard provides detailed usage data and performance summaries for each project, helping creators track the reach and adoption of their work.

### Key Metrics

Key metrics include: **Total Views** (total views across all projects), **Total Credits Spent** (total Credits consumed by other users in your projects), and **Total Incentive** (total cash earned from the platform's incentive mechanism).

### Project Details Table

In the Project details table, each project displays: project name and publication date, Credits Spent (total Credits consumed when others use your project), Times Used (number of times the project has been invoked), Incentive (cumulative incentive amount generated by the project), Views (number of visits), and Built On / Saves (number of times remixed or saved).

<Tip>
Through this data, you can observe which projects are most popular, most frequently used, or generating the most revenue.

## Monetization

**Monetization** manages incentive earnings and withdrawal progress, with the interface divided into two sections: account overview and transaction history.

### Account Overview

- **Account Balance**: Current account balance
- **Total earnings**: Cumulative total earnings
- **Withdrawn / Processing**: Withdrawal history and amounts being processed
- **Request Withdrawal**: Click to initiate a withdrawal request (requires balance ≥ $50 USD)

### Transaction History

**Transactions** clearly display: the source of each incentive, amount, payment method, status (such as Completed), and date. All records are updated daily and are transparent and verifiable.

## Incentive Calculation

The incentive calculation method currently works by creators receiving cash incentives based on the Credits consumed by others when using their projects.

<Info>
Total Credits consumed by others using the project → platform operating costs deducted → 50% of the remaining portion converted at **100 Credits = 1 USD**.
</Info>

### Example Calculation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Total Consumption">
    Total user consumption: 10,000 Credits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Platform Costs">
    Platform costs: 8,000 Credits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remaining Credits">
    Remaining: 2,000 Credits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creator Share">
    Creator share: 50% → 1,000 Credits = **$10 USD reward**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Incentives are settled once daily and updated to the Monetization panel at 03:00 AM (UTC+0) each day.
</Warning>

## Creative Loop

Creator Studio is the convergence point of creation and earnings, allowing each project to not only be seen but also generate tangible returns, achieving a true creative loop.
