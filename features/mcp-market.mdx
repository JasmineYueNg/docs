## What is MCP Market?

MCP Market is YouWare's integrated marketplace where you can discover, explore, and install MCP tools that extend your project's capabilities. Instead of manually configuring integrations, MCP Market provides a curated collection of tools organized by category—making it easy to find exactly what you need.

Think of it as an app store for your YouWare projects, where every tool is pre-configured and ready to integrate.
