# Remix

<Note>
**Smart Creation Accelerator**

The Remix feature makes creation faster and smarter. Modify, update, or rebuild directly on someone else's project—from inspiration to implementation in just one step.
</Note>

## How It Works

When you see a project you like, there's no need to copy or recreate it. Simply click the **Remix** button on the project details page to open the Remix panel in the conversation.

<Info>
The system automatically loads the project's basic structure and content, allowing you to continue creating directly on top of existing work.

## Quick Modification Options

After opening Remix, you'll see several preset quick modification options:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Replace Content" icon="copy">
    Update images or text elements
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Theme" icon="palette">
    Try different layouts or color schemes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add Sections" icon="plus">
    Include new components or features
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Custom Modifications

You can also directly enter your modification requirements in the input box. The agent will execute modifications based on the current project without needing to regenerate the entire webpage.

<Accordion title="Example Modification Requests">
  - "Change the page background to dark"
  - "Make the buttons rounded" 
  - "Add an image upload area"
  - "Change webpage colors to primarily yellow and green"
</Accordion>

## Key Benefits

The biggest advantage of Remix is that it eliminates the need to rebuild. Compared to creating a project from scratch, Remix directly reuses existing structures, code, and assets.
