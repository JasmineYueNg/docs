## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will remixing a project change the original?">
    No. When you remix a project, you create a completely independent copy. The original project remains unchanged. Your remixed version is your own separate project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need coding skills to remix a project?">
    No. You can remix using natural language prompts like "Make the buttons bigger" or "Change the background color." No coding required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I remix a remixed project?">
    Yes. You can remix any public project, including projects that were already remixed from other projects. Each remix is a new, independent copy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does remixing cost?">
    Remixing itself is free. You only pay Credits when you ask the AI to make modifications to your remixed copy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I remix a private or password-protected project?">
    You can only remix projects that are publicly shared. Private projects cannot be remixed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does remixing create a link to the original project?">
    Yes. Your remixed project displays credit to the original creator and links back to the original project on the project details page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to remix a project?">
    Creating the copy is instant. Making modifications takes a few seconds depending on complexity. You can see live updates as changes are applied.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I undo changes after remixing?">
    Yes. You can request new changes or edit your remix copy to revert modifications. The original project is never affected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the original creator disabled remix?">
    If a project creator has disabled the remix option (marked "Remix Permissions: Off"), you cannot remix that project. The remix button will be disabled and cannot be clicked. Only projects with remix enabled can be remixed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I download the code from a remixed project?">
    No. Projects created through remix cannot be downloaded as source code. This protects the original creator's work. If you need to download code, create a project from scratch instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can someone remix my project if I set remix permissions to off?">
    No. If remix is disabled, the project becomes read-only. Other users can view it but not modify or copy it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many times my project can be remixed?">
    No. If you allow remix, anyone can create unlimited copies from your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see who remixed my project?">
    Yes. Remixed projects link back to the original, so you can see remixes in your Creator Studio analytics.
