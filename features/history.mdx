<Info>
**Undo on steroids.**

Every change you make is saved automatically. Rewind to any version anytime—your work is always safe.
</Info>

## Why History Matters

You're building. Experimenting. Trying bold ideas.

Then something breaks. Or you realize the version from 10 minutes ago was actually better.

**History has your back.** Every edit, every AI generation, every tweak—automatically saved as a new version. You can jump back to any moment with one click.

No lost work. No panic. Just confidence.

## How It Works

![History versions panel showing modification timeline](/images/history-versions-pannel.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open History">
    Click the **History icon** in the top toolbar (looks like a clock).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse Versions">
    See your project's timeline. Each version shows what changed and when.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preview Any Version">
    Click a version to preview it instantly. See exactly what your project looked like at that moment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restore">
    Found the version you want? Click **Restore this version**. Done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important: Restoring is permanent.**

Once you restore a version, **all versions after it are gone**. You won't be able to access anything that happened after that point.

Example: If you restore Version 20, you lose Versions 21, 22, 23, and everything after.

**Credits are not refunded** when you restore. Use [Credit Care](/introduction/youware-credit-care) if you want to refund credits from a failed attempt.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Preview carefully before restoring. Make sure it's the exact version you want—there's no undo for this action.
</Tip>

## What Gets Saved

Every version captures:
- All code changes
- Visual edits you made
- AI-generated updates
- Manual file edits

Each version includes:
- **Description** — What changed
- **Timestamp** — Exactly when it happened
- **Full snapshot** — Complete state of your project

## Pro Tips

<Accordion title="Versions save automatically">
You don't need to do anything. Every time you make a change or the AI generates something, a new version is created instantly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Versions never expire">
Your history stays forever. Come back weeks later and find any version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Always preview before restoring">
**Critical:** Preview the version first. Once you restore, everything after that version is permanently lost. There's no undo.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Want credits back? Use Credit Care instead">
Restoring doesn't refund credits. If you want to recover credits from a failed attempt, use [Credit Care](/introduction/youware-credit-care) to rewind AND get your credits back.
</Accordion>
