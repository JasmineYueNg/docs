**New to YouWare Backend?** Learn about the [complete backend infrastructure and real-world use cases](/connections/youware-backend-integration) before diving into this quick start guide.
</Info>

YouWare Backend transforms static web pages into dynamic applications with persistent data storage, automated functions, and real user authentication - all without writing backend code.

This guide shows you how to get started in minutes.

## Get Started in 3 Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Add YouWare Backend MCP">
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/youware-backend-add-mcp.gif" alt="Adding YouWare Backend MCP from the marketplace" />
  </Frame>

  Open your YouWare project:

  1. Click on the **MCP icon** on the left sidebar
  2. Find **YouWare Backend** in the Marketplace
  3. Click on the checkbox

  <Check>
  You're all set! Now you can start building with backend capabilities.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Database">
  <video controls width="100%">
    <source src="/images/youware-backend-create-database.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  In the dialog box, type: **"Create a voting database with: option name, number of votes, voter ID."**

  The data table is created and you will see the field structure:
  - `option_name` (TEXT)
  - `vote_count` (INTEGER)
  - `voter_id` (TEXT)
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy a Backend Function">
  <video controls width="100%">
    <source src="/images/youware-backend-deploy-function.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  In the dialog box, type: **"deploy a function that automatically calculates the percentage and updates the page after each vote"**

  <Check>
  Your backend is live! Each time a user votes, the function will automatically calculate the result and update it in real time.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Manipulate Databases in Natural Language

Once you've created your data table, it's straightforward to tell the AI what you want to do:

- **Add data:** "add three options: apple, banana, orange, the initial votes are all 0"
- **Query data:** "display all the current options and the number of votes"
- **Modify data:** "Increase the number of votes for 'apple' by 1"
- **Delete data:** "delete the option with 0 votes"
- **Modify the table structure:** "add a 'Voting Time' field to the voting table"

- Pause or restart the project
- Download project data

### Pause and Restart Projects

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/youware-backend-pause-restart.png" alt="Pause and restart project controls in Backend Usage" />
</Frame>

**Pause the project:**

1. Find the target project in Backend Usage
2. Click the **Pause** button
3. Confirm the prompt (data is retained for 7 days)

The backend stops immediately and the frontend stays online.

**Restart the project:**

1. Find the project in Backend Usage that is in cooling off period
2. Click the **Run** button
3. Resume immediately if there is enough credit in the package

### Download Project Data

**Three ways:**

1. **Backend Usage popup:** Click the avatar in the upper right corner to enter the backend view, click export
2. **Project page:**
   - Expand the drop-down bar in the upper left corner → Download → select type (ALL / Code / Data)
   - Switch to the database view → click the download button
3. **Dialog box:** type "download data" and click the button prompted by AI

## Data Retention Policy

<Warning>
**Important:** Understanding data retention helps you avoid data loss.
</Warning>

**Data retention timeline:**

- Backend **stops working immediately** after suspension of service or expiration of subscription
- Data **is retained for 7 days**, during which time it can be restarted or downloaded
- **After 7 days it is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered**

**System reminders:**

The system will remind you via email and inbox message (on the day of expiration, the 3rd day, the 6th day) to ensure timely download of data.

<Info>
Your website continues to be online and all front-end code remains intact. Only the back-end functionality stops working.
</Info>

- Frontend code can be remixed (for learning purposes)
- Backend functions and databases are completely private
- No one else can access your data

Your data is safe and secure.

## Quick Tips

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I check my project status?">
  Click your avatar in the upper right corner → Backend. The status shows either **in service** (green) or **cooling off period (X days)** (orange).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can backend functions call external APIs?">
  Yes! Private keys (e.g. LLM API Key) are securely stored in the backend, so frontend code won't expose them. You can safely integrate third-party services.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the three ways to download data?">
  1. **Backend Usage popup:** Avatar → Backend → Export
  2. **Project page:** Upper left dropdown → Download → select Data
  3. **Dialog box:** Type "download data" and follow AI prompts
