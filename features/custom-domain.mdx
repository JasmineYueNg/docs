<Info>
Launch every YouWare project under your brand. Custom domains let you publish AI-built sites and apps on URLs your audience trusts.

## What Is a Custom Domain?

A custom domain is a unique website address that belongs to you or your organization. Instead of sharing a generic link, your project lives on a name that is personal, memorable, and brand-ready:

- `www.freshbrewcafe.com`
- `courses.byemma.com`
- `mychurchonline.org`

When you attach a custom domain, your AI-built website or app immediately looks professional the moment it goes live.

### Who Benefits Most

- Local businesses such as restaurants, salons, clinics, and retail shops
- Educators, coaches, and online course creators
- Churches, communities, and nonprofits
- Freelancers, agencies, and personal portfolios
- Any creator launching a public-facing product or service

## Connect Your Custom Domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish Your Project">
    Publish your YouWare project just like any other launch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Domain Settings">
    Click **Custom Domain** in your project settings, then choose **Add Domain**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Domain">
    Type the domain you own (from providers like GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Name.com, or similar registrars).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy DNS Values">
    Copy the TXT and CNAME values displayed in the YouWare dashboard. These records verify ownership and route traffic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Your DNS Provider">
    Paste the records into your registrar's DNS settings exactly as shown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify & Launch">
    Click **Verify** in YouWare and wait for propagation. Once complete, your project serves from your custom domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Propagation times vary. TXT records usually verify within minutes, while CNAME routing can take up to 24 hours depending on your provider.
</Tip>

### DNS Provider Examples

Use your registrar's dashboard to add the records:

- Cloudflare — supports root domain CNAMEs through CNAME flattening.
- Namecheap — provides dedicated CNAME record types for root and subdomains.
- GoDaddy, Alibaba Cloud, and other legacy registrars may require you to use `www` or another subdomain.

## Private Access (Passcode)

Custom domains aren't only for branding—they can protect access, too. Pair your domain with **Private Access (Passcode)** to require a passcode before anyone can view your site.

Perfect for:

- Internal dashboards and tooling
- Paid courses or premium lessons
- Client deliverables and work-in-progress demos
- Church groups, schools, or invitation-only communities

Publish publicly, share privately, and still keep everything under your own URL.

## Configuration Values

To connect your domain, add **two DNS records**. Copy the exact values from your YouWare dashboard for the project you are publishing.

### 1. Ownership Verification (TXT)

- Host: `_youware-verify`
- Value: (copy the TXT string from the dashboard)
- Purpose: proves you own the domain before traffic is routed

Most providers automatically append your domain to the host field. Only enter the full domain if your registrar explicitly requires it.

### 2. Traffic Routing (CNAME)

- Host: the hostname you want to use (for example `www`)
- Value: the CNAME target provided by YouWare
- Purpose: points traffic from your domain to YouWare's infrastructure

<Warning>
A CNAME record must be the only record for that hostname. Remove any conflicting A or AAAA records before saving.
</Warning>

## Root Domain CNAME Limitations

Standard DNS rules do not allow a CNAME record on the root domain (`example.com`). Work around the limitation in one of two ways:

- **Use a subdomain (recommended for most providers)**  
  Create a CNAME for `www.example.com`. Set up URL forwarding from the root to `www` if needed.
- **Switch to a provider that supports root CNAMEs**  
  Cloudflare (via CNAME flattening) and Namecheap support this behavior. Update your nameservers, then add the root CNAME directly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is my status still Pending after adding records?">
    DNS propagation is not instant. TXT records typically verify within 10 minutes, while CNAME changes can take up to 24 hours. Double-check that your record values match the dashboard exactly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should Cloudflare proxy be on or off?">
    For the TXT record, leave proxying off (grey cloud). For CNAME records you can enable the orange cloud to leverage Cloudflare. If verification stalls, temporarily turn it off and retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a CNAME and TXT record share the same host?">
    No. DNS standards block a CNAME from coexisting with other records on the same host. That is why YouWare uses `_youware-verify` for TXT verification—it keeps routing and verification separate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My site sometimes loads the wrong content. What should I check?">
    Ensure there are no leftover A or AAAA records for the same host. Remove duplicates, then wait for DNS caches to expire.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
