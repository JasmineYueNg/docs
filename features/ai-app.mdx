## <Icon icon="puzzle" /> MCP Integration

AI App works as an MCP Tool and can be directly combined with other tools (such as Figma, Backend, Image Generator) to achieve end-to-end automation.

**For example:**

- After converting a Figma design into a webpage, embed intelligent chat functionality into it
- Use YouWare Backend to create leaderboards, comment sections, or data storage to provide contextual support for AI models
