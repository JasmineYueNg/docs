For the same requirement, it takes 20 points with Claude and 5 points with GLM. But Claude can handle complex tasks at once, GLM may need to debug 3 times.

<Tip>
**Model selection directly determines your efficiency and cost.** YouWare now integrates 5 top AI models, from OpenAI and Anthropic to Moonshot and Z.ai - you can switch at any time in the bottom right corner of the input box to match the task to pick the right tool.

## Why Multiple Models Matter

**A single model can't fulfill all scenarios:**
