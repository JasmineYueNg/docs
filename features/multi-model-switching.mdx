# Multi-Model Switching

For the same requirement, it takes 20 points with Claude and 5 points with GLM. But Claude can handle complex tasks at once, GLM may need to debug 3 times.

<Tip>
**Model selection directly determines your efficiency and cost.** YouWare now integrates 5 top AI models, from OpenAI and Anthropic to Moonshot and Z.ai - you can switch at any time in the bottom right corner of the input box to match the task to pick the right tool.

## Why Multiple Models Matter

**A single model can't fulfill all scenarios:**

    Don't need the most intelligence, but are burning the most expensive points

  <Card title="Complex Agent Tasks" icon="brain">

## How to Switch Models

<Accordion title="Quick Switching Guide">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open Model Selector">
      Click the current model name (default "Claude Sonnet 4.5") in the lower right corner of the input box
    </Step>
    <Step title="Browse Available Models">
      Drop-down menu shows all 5 models
    </Step>
    <Step title="Review Model Details">
      Hover to view detailed information card (speed, intelligence, cost, support capability)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Confirm Selection">
      Click on the target model and "âœ“" on the right to confirm switching
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

## Model Information Cards

<Accordion title="What's Included in Each Card">
  Each model information card provides comprehensive decision-making data:
