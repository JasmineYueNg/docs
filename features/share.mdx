Publish your project to get a shareable link. You control access, descriptions, and remix permissions.

## Publishing

    Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of your project

  <Step title="Share">
    Click the **Share** button to get your project link
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your project generates a unique link that you can share with anyone.

## Your Project Link

After publishing, your project gets a standard link showing the work and description.

### Auto-Generated Description

When you share a project, a short description is automatically created based on your project content.

## Mobile App Integration

When someone opens your shared link in the YouWare mobile app, they go directly to the project details page. This gives them quick access to your work with one tap, and they can remix it if you've allowed it.

## Privacy & Sharing Settings

Privacy and Remix settings are available on [paid plans](https://www.youware.com/subscription) only.
