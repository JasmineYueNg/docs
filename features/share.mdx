Publish your project to get a shareable link. You control access, descriptions, and remix permissions.

## Publishing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share">
    Click the **Share** button to get your project link
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your project generates a unique link that you can share with anyone.

## Your Project Link

After publishing, your project gets a standard link showing the work and description.

### Auto-Generated Description

When you share a project, a short description is automatically created based on your project content.

### Fullscreen Mode

Click **Share in fullscreen** to get a link that shows only your project—without the YouWare interface or description. Use this for:
- Demos to clients
- Embedding in other websites
- Clean portfolios

## Mobile App Integration

When someone opens your shared link in the YouWare mobile app, they go directly to the project details page. This gives them quick access to your work with one tap, and they can remix it if you've allowed it.

## Privacy & Sharing Settings

Click **Settings** to control who can access and modify your project:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Private Projects">
    Require a four-character password to access. The system generates one automatically, and you can share it with whoever you choose.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remix Permissions">
    Allow or disable other users from remixing (copying and modifying) your project. When disabled, it becomes read-only.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does my shared link expire?">
    No. Your project link stays active as long as your project is published. If you unpublish it, the link becomes inactive.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change the auto-generated description?">
    No. The description is automatically generated when you share your project. To control what others see, you can make the project private or delete it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between standard and fullscreen links?">
    Standard links show your project with the YouWare header and description. Fullscreen links show only the project itself, ideal for clean demos or embedding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track how many times my project was viewed?">
    Views are tracked in your Creator Studio dashboard. You can see total views and how many people have used your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stop sharing my project?">
    Delete the project or set it to private (which requires a password to access). There is no unpublish option—published projects stay live unless you delete or restrict them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I make an already-shared project private?">
    Yes. Go to **Settings** and enable **Private Projects** to add password protection. Existing links will still work, but viewers will need the password.
