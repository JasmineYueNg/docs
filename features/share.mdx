  **Share & Publish Your Projects**
  
  Publish your work online, generate links, and control visibility. With just one click, take your creation from the editor to the world.
</Note>

## Publishing Your Project

After completing your project, you can publish it in two ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Quick Publish">
    Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share Menu">
    Select "Publish" from the **Share** menu
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once published, the project will generate an accessible online version and automatically be assigned a unique link. You don't need to manually deploy or configure serversâ€”the system completes the publishing process instantly.

## Accessing Your Published Link

After publishing, click the **Share** button in the top-right corner to view your project's access link. This link defaults to the YouWare project page, which includes the work display and description information.

### Fullscreen Mode

If you want to display only the work itself without the YouWare interface or description page, you can select **"Share in fullscreen"** mode.

<Info>
In fullscreen mode, the link will automatically update to a fullscreen link, showing only the web content you generated. The system will generate an independent fullscreen access URL.
</Info>

**Ideal for:**
- Showcasing pure work visuals or application interfaces
- Presenting Demo pages to clients or audiences  
- Embedding directly into personal websites or portfolios

## Privacy & Sharing Settings

Click the **Settings** icon in the top-left corner of the project interface to manage sharing permissions and privacy settings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ðŸ”’ Private Project Settings">
    When enabled, accessing the project requires entering a **four-character password**. The password is automatically generated by the system, and you can freely distribute it to those you want to grant access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ðŸ“‹ Remix Permissions">
    When allowed, other users can "Remix" your projectâ€”their copies will be saved independently without affecting your original version. When disabled, the project will be locked as read-only, preventing anyone from copying and modifying it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use private projects with password protection for sensitive work, and disable remix for projects you want to keep as read-only showcases.
