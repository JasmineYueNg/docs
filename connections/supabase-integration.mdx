## What is the Supabase Tool?

The Supabase tool connects your YouWare project to your Supabase backend—an open-source alternative to Firebase. This integration enables the AI to use your existing data as a source of truth, reading your Supabase tables and functions to understand your data model and generate code that interacts correctly with your database.

<Info>
**Key Points:**
- **Purpose**: Connects YouWare to your Supabase database and backend services
- **Function**: Allows the AI to read your data schema and use your data as context for code and content generation
- **Benefit**: Enables the AI to build data-aware applications with real-time database connectivity
- **Data Source**: Transforms your Supabase repository data into valuable context for the AI

## How to Get Your Supabase Access Key for MCP

To connect Supabase, you need to generate a Service Role Key that allows YouWare's MCP to securely access your database for content generation.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Access Token Page">
Go to the [Supabase Token Settings page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) to generate your personal access token.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate and Copy Token">
- Click the green **Generate new token** button
- In the pop-up, give your token a name like `YouWare MCP` and confirm
- Once generated, **copy the token immediately** — you won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
Keep your Service Role Key secure. It provides elevated access to your database and should never be exposed in client-side code.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Service Role Key">
When connecting in YouWare, use this generated token as your Supabase Service Role Key. This grants the necessary read access for the AI to understand your data model.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between the Service Role Key and the Anon Key?">
The Service Role Key has elevated privileges and bypasses Row Level Security (RLS), making it suitable for server-side operations. The Anon Key is safe for client-side use but respects RLS policies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my database secure with this integration?">
Yes, when properly configured. Always keep your Service Role Key private and implement appropriate RLS policies in Supabase to control data access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can the AI write to my database?">
The AI can generate code that writes to your database, but the actual write operations depend on the permissions granted by your Service Role Key and your Supabase security policies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does this work with Supabase Edge Functions?">
Yes, the AI can read and understand your Edge Functions to generate code that properly integrates with your serverless backend logic.
