## Why Integrations Matter

<Tip>
Remember when smartphones were just for calls? Then apps came along and changed everything. **That's exactly what MCP Tools do for your YouWare project.**
</Tip>

MCP Tools are like apps for your website. Install one, and suddenly your project can connect with the services you already love—ChatGPT, Figma, Notion, and dozens more. Think of them as smart adapters that help your site plug into the tools you rely on every day, so everything works together instead of living in separate silos.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are MCP Tools?" icon="puzzle-piece">
    MCP Tools (Model Context Protocol Tools) are pre-built integrations that extend your YouWare project's capabilities. They work like plugins or apps, allowing your website to connect with external services like AI models, databases, design tools, and content platforms—all without writing complex code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need coding experience to use integrations?" icon="users">
    Not at all! That's the beauty of YouWare integrations. Simply select the tool you need, describe what you want in plain English, and YouWare handles all the technical implementation. Whether you're integrating AI image generation or connecting to your Notion workspace, it's all done through our intuitive interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple integrations in one project?" icon="zap">
    Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. You can combine multiple MCP Tools to create powerful, feature-rich applications. For example, you might use Figma to import your design, AI App to generate content, Supabase to manage your database, and Unsplash for images—all in the same project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between YouWare Backend and Supabase?" icon="database">
    **YouWare Backend** is our built-in data management solution—perfect for simple data storage and retrieval with zero configuration. **Supabase** is a more robust, full-featured database platform ideal for complex applications that need advanced querying, real-time updates, or authentication features. Choose based on your project's complexity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are my API keys and data secure?" icon="shield">
    Yes. YouWare uses industry-standard encryption to protect all credentials and data. Your API keys are stored securely and never exposed in your code. We follow best practices for data privacy and security, and you maintain full control over your integrations at all times.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I remove an integration later?" icon="settings">
    Of course! You can add or remove integrations anytime without affecting your project's core functionality. If you remove an integration, any features that depend on it will stop working, but your other features remain intact. You can always re-add it later if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the integration I need isn't available?" icon="globe">
    We're constantly adding new MCP Tools based on user feedback. If you need a specific integration, let us know through our feedback form or community forum. In the meantime, you can often use the **Web Scraper** or **API integration** tools to connect with custom services.
