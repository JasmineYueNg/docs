## What is the Google Maps Connection?

Mention any place, neighborhood, or coordinates in your prompt—YouWare fetches verified Google Maps data and designs sections around it. Build a “Best coffee in Seattle” directory, surface review highlights for “Mr Beast burger locations”, or embed interactive maps that jump straight to Google navigation.

## Prompt Example

```text
"Create a research microsite for Tokyo Tower visitors that highlights the five best cafes within 1 km,
including their specialties, signature drinks, opening hours, transport options, and a one-click navigation button."
```

---

## Example: Tokyo Tower Cafe Tour

When you run the prompt above, YouWare:

1. Queries Google Maps for cafés within the requested radius, ranked by rating and review volume.  
2. Generates rich cards for each café (brand story, must-try drink, hours, contact info, transport notes, and latest review snippets).  
3. Embeds a Google Maps component with custom pins plus a “Plan Route” button that launches Google Maps directions from the user’s location.  
4. Creates comparison tables (price level, seating, Wi-Fi availability) and suggested itineraries around Tokyo Tower.  

This lets you ship an actionable local guide in minutes—perfect for tourism boards, creator newsletters, concierge teams, or sponsored campaigns.

## Best Practices

- **Be precise with geography:** Mention city, neighborhood, or radius to keep results relevant  
- **Mix narrative + data:** Ask for storytelling sections (“Why visit?”, “Local tips”) alongside map cards  
- **Group by intent:** Separate categories like dining, lodging, attractions, or coworking spaces for easier browsing  
- **Pair with Backend:** Save user-generated favorites or trip notes in YouWare Backend for personalized experiences  
- **Enable route planning:** Ask explicitly for “one-click navigation” to surface Google Maps links or embedded directions  
- **Use Street View + photos:** Request hero images or galleries sourced from Google photo data to boost engagement
