## What is the Figma Integration?

The Figma integration bridges the gap between design and development by connecting your design files directly to YouWare's AI. Using Figma's "Copy link to selection" feature, you can point our AI to any component, section, or entire page in your design. The AI then analyzes the visual context to generate pixel-perfect web code.

## Setup Your Figma Access Token

<Warning>
  You need a Personal Access Token (PAT) to connect Figma. This token allows YouWare's MCP to securely access your design files via the Figma API.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Profile Settings">
    Click on your avatar in the top-left corner of Figma and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Security">
    In the Settings page, select the **Security** tab and scroll down to the **Personal access tokens** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate New Token">
    Click the **Generate new token** button to create a new access token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Token Settings">
    Set up your token with the following configuration:

    - **Token Name:** `YouWare MCP` (or any recognizable name)
    - **Expiration:** 90 days (recommended for security)
    - **Required Scopes:**
      - `file_content:read`
      - `file_dev_resources:read`
      - `projects:read`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Token Securely">
    <Note>
      Copy the token immediately after generation - you won't be able to see it again!
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practice: Section-by-Section Conversion

<Tip>
  For optimal results, convert your Figma designs section by section rather than converting entire pages at once.
</Tip>

### Why This Approach Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Higher Accuracy" icon="star">
    AI focuses on specific details of each section for precise code generation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Better Structure" icon="box">
    Each section gets properly organized code with clean boundaries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easier Debugging" icon="bug">
    Quickly identify and fix issues in specific sections
  </Card>
  <Card title="Faster Iterations" icon="chevrons-right">
    Make changes to individual sections without regenerating entire pages
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Implementation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Design Section">
    In Figma, select a specific section (header, hero, features, footer, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Section Link">
    Right-click and choose "Copy link to selection"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Code">
    Paste the link into YouWare and let the AI generate that section's code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat for Each Section">
    Continue this process for each major section of your design
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assemble Final Page">
    The AI will combine all sections into a cohesive, fully functional page
  </Step>
</Steps>
