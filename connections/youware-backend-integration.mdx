## Why YouWare Backend is Different

Here's the thing: most platforms make you piece together your backend like a puzzle—one service for your database (Upstash), another for authentication (Auth0), another for storage (Vercel Blob), and so on. **YouWare Backend? We built the whole thing ourselves, from the ground up.**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Other Platforms" icon="puzzle-piece">
    **Fragmented third-party integrations**
    
    - Database from Upstash
    - Auth from one provider
    - Storage from Vercel Blob
    - Functions from another service
    - You manage multiple dashboards, APIs, and billing
  </Card>
  <Card title="YouWare Backend" icon="rocket">
    **One unified, self-developed solution**
    
    - Everything built in-house
    - Database + Auth + Functions + Storage
    - Single dashboard, single integration
    - Works seamlessly out of the box
    - No juggling multiple platforms
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**The bottom line:** You get a fully integrated backend that just works—no configuration headaches, no compatibility issues, no vendor lock-in across multiple services. Just tell us what you want to build, and we make it happen.
