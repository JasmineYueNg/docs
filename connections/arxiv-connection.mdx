## What is the arXiv Connection?

Mention any topic, category, author, or arXiv ID in your prompt—YouWare fetches the relevant papers and builds experiences around them. Summaries, comparison tables, citation callouts, and call-to-actions all use verified metadata direct from arXiv.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the connection">
    Open **Connections → arXiv** in your workspace and toggle it on. No credentials or rate-limit configuration required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the research scope">
    In your prompt, specify topics, arXiv categories, authors, or timeframes. Example:  
    _“Create a briefing on diffusion models published on arXiv in the last six months, highlighting breakthroughs and practical implications.”_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review generated sections">
    YouWare assembles paper cards, abstract highlights, comparison tables, and CTA buttons linking to full PDFs or code repos.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regenerate for new papers">
    When you need newer publications, re-run your prompt to fetch the latest data. Background auto-updates are not available yet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompt Example

```text
"Generate a research dashboard summarizing the top five arXiv papers on multimodal LLMs,
including abstracts, author lists, publication dates, citations, key takeaways,
and links to PDFs and GitHub repositories."
```

---

## Example: AI Safety Research Briefing

Run a prompt such as the one above and YouWare will:

1. Query arXiv for papers matching your topic and timeframe.  
2. Extract abstracts, methodologies, links, and author affiliations.  
3. Produce analyst-ready summaries, comparison tables, and recommended follow-up reading.  
4. Add shareable widgets—email signup, download bundles, or “Discuss with the team” CTAs.  

Perfect for CTO updates, investor memos, academic newsletters, or student research portals.

## Best Practices

- **Narrow the scope:** Include category tags (e.g., `cs.CL`, `cs.AI`) or keywords to keep results focused  
- **Blend qualitative + quantitative:** Ask for metrics (citations, publication date) alongside commentary (“Why it matters”)  
- **Call out actionable insights:** Request “Key takeaways”, “Implementation checklist”, or “Questions for stakeholders” sections  
- **Pair with Backend:** Store curated reading lists, reviewer notes, or approval workflows using YouWare Backend  
- **Automate newsletters manually:** Re-run the prompt on your preferred cadence to keep subscribers updated with the latest research
