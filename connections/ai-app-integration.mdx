# AI API

<Info>
  Build AI-powered websites with ease—chatbots, image generators, and more.
</Info>

## What is the AI API?

The AI API is YouWare's powerful feature that lets you **build AI-driven websites and applications** by connecting to specialized third-party AI models and services.

<Warning>
  **Important:** The AI API is NOT for generating your website design or layout. Instead, it's a tool that **enables your finished website to call AI APIs**—so you can create functional AI applications like chatbots, image generation sites, sentiment analysis tools, video creation platforms, and more.
</Warning>

Think of it this way: YouWare's core AI helps you build the website structure. The AI API gives your website the ability to **perform AI tasks for your end users**—like generating images, analyzing text, or answering questions in real-time.

**What makes it special?** We handle all the API complexity for you. No API keys to manage, no token calculations to worry about, and no risk of surprise bills. Everything is securely wrapped in YouWare Credits—one simple payment system for all AI models.
