### Pro Tips to Save Credits

1. **Start small** — Use a low/standard model first, upgrade if needed
2. **Batch operations** — Process multiple requests together when possible
3. **Optimize prompts** — Better descriptions = fewer re-runs
4. **Version control** — Save what works so you don't re-run experiments
5. **Quality settings** — Use lower quality settings for drafts and previews
