## What is the YouTube Connection?

The YouTube connection lets YouWare analyze any channel you mention in your prompt—e.g. _“Build a research site for the MrBeast YouTube channel”_. The AI fetches real channel data (subscriber counts, playlists, top videos, latest uploads) and designs pages that embed playable videos with jump links back to YouTube.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the connection">
    In your workspace, open **Connections → YouTube** and toggle it on. No Google Cloud setup or API keys required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the channel or topic">
    In your prompt, reference the creator, channel ID, video, or keywords you need. Example:  
    _“Create a competitive analysis page for MrBeast’s YouTube channel showcasing top videos, upload cadence, and audience stats.”_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview the generated sections">
    YouWare builds hero sections, galleries, analytics widgets, and CTAs populated with live channel data and video links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regenerate to refresh">
    Whenever you regenerate or request a manual sync, YouWare fetches the latest stats and updates the layouts accordingly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompt Example

"Build a research microsite for the MrBeast YouTube channel.
Include subscriber milestones, a grid of the latest uploads with direct links,
and a table comparing performance of his most-watched videos."
```

## Best Practices

- **Be specific in prompts:** Mention channel names, playlists, or target audiences (“compare tech review channels”)  
- **Mix text + video:** Ask for executive summaries, sponsor callouts, or insight panels alongside embeds  
- **Combine with Backend:** Save curated playlists, survey results, or partner leads directly into YouWare Backend  
- **Leverage Shorts + Livestreams:** Call out trending Shorts or upcoming live events for richer engagement  
- **Use Credit Care:** Iterate on layouts without fear—undo attempts that miss the mark and retry instantly

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a YouTube API key?">
    No. Once the YouTube connection is enabled in your YouWare workspace, data fetching is handled automatically—no Google Cloud project or keys required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I limit results to specific videos or playlists?">
    Yes. Mention the exact channel, playlist, video IDs, or keywords in your prompt. YouWare only surfaces the sources you describe.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does this work with Shorts and livestreams?">
    Absolutely. Shorts and live replay metadata are treated like standard videos—YouWare can create story strips, highlight sections, or event countdowns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often is the data refreshed?">
    Every time you regenerate the page or request a manual sync. You can also set automatic schedules inside Connections → YouTube.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will embedding lots of videos hurt performance?">
    YouWare lazy-loads embeds and uses optimized thumbnails until interaction. You can also choose text-only cards that open modals or link directly to YouTube.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I mix YouTube data with other sources?">
    Yes. Blend YouTube insights with YouWare Backend, Notion, or Supabase connections to enrich pages with articles, products, or community feedback.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is quota a concern?">
    YouWare respects YouTube’s public data limits. For channel research use cases, default quotas are typically sufficient; high-volume enterprise needs can request expanded access through support.
